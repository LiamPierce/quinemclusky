# quinemclusky
ECSE315 Quine Mclusky, MOPI, Tag Tabulation programs.

## Usage

The "logic" and "logicm" (for logic multi-output) programs allow you to solve the quine mcluskey (with or without letting you stop at each relevant term). For the multi-output program, it does the tag tabulation procedure but doesn't actually solve the multi-output problem, it only displays the correct table. You'll have to figure out the prime implicants yourself by looking at the terms it generates. When you get to the final step, where it shows prime implicants, you should ignore its output it is showing you the output without considering the MOPI, it is just solving the whole table. It outputs the terms one at a time to make it easier to work with and verify.

The "boolsimp" program is a TI program for simplifying boolean expressions. Make sure you clear variables a-z, also it only allows one character variables and ignores case.

There may be bugs, but it worked fine for me.
