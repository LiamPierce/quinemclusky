# quinemclusky
ECSE315 Quine Mclusky, MOPI, Tag Tabulation programs.

## Usage

The "logic" and "logicm" (for logic multi-output) programs allow you to solve the quine mcluskey (with or without letting you stop at each relevant term). For the multi-output program, it does the tag tabulation procedure but doesn't actually solve the multi-output problem, it only displays the correct table. You'll have to figure out the prime implicants yourself by looking at the terms it generates.

The "boolsimp" program is a TI program for simplifying boolean expressions. Make sure you clear variables a-z, also it only allows one character variables and ignores case.

There may be bugs, but it worked fine for me.
